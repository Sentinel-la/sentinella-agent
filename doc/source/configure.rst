Generate an initial configuration file
======================================


Except for the debian package, you will need to generate the tourbillon's configuration file.

By default, the tourbillon's configuration is stored in **/etc/tourbillon/tourbillon.conf**.

To generate the configuration file type the following command: ::

	$ tourbillon init


The init command will ask you for the InfluxDB's connection parameters and the logging configuration.

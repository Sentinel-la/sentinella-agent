## Installation

### Using distribution packages

[tourbillon_0.4.2_amd64.deb](https://github.com/tourbillonpy/tourbillon-agent/releases/download/0.4.2/tourbillon_0.4.2_amd64.deb)

[tourbillon_0.4.2_i386.deb](https://github.com/tourbillonpy/tourbillon-agent/releases/download/0.4.2/tourbillon_0.4.2_i386.deb)

Run dpkg to install it:

```
$ sudo dpkg -i tourbillon_0.4.2_amd64.deb
```

or for the 32 bit version:

```
$ sudo dpkg -i tourbillon_0.4.2_i386.deb
```



#### Centos 6.6


Download the rpm package for your architecture:


[tourbillon-0.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm](https://github.com/tourbillonpy/tourbillon-agent/releases/download/0.4.2/tourbillon-0.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm)

[tourbillon-0.4.2-1.i686.rpm](https://github.com/tourbillonpy/tourbillon-agent/releases/download/0.4.2/tourbillon-0.4.2-1.i686.rpm)


Run rpm to install it:

```

or for the 32 bit version:

```



### Using pip

**_It's strongly recomended to install tourbillon inside a virtualenv._**


```
$ pip install tourbillon
```


## Generate an initial configuration file

Except for the debian package, you will need to generate the tourbillon's configuration file.

By default, the tourbillon's configuration is stored in **/etc/tourbillon/tourbillon.conf**.

To generate the configuration file type the following command:

```
$ tourbillon init
```

The init command will ask you for the InfluxDB's connection parameters and the logging configuration.



## List available Tourbillon plugins
tourbillon has an index of official, featured and unofficial plugins.
The plugins listed in the index are python packages hosted on pypi.

You can list the plugins present in the index by typing:

```
$ tourbillon list
```

The output of this command will only show the plugins compatible with you python runtime version.


## Install plugins

To install a plugin enter:

```
$ tourbillon install <plugin-name>
```

After the installation it will be needed to create the plugin configuration file.
By default tourbillon search for the plugins configuration file in **/etc/tourbillon/conf.d**.
Please refer to the plugin documentation for detailed instruction.


# Start tourbillon
